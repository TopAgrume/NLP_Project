ebony and crows   and that small mole  on your left cheekbone.   or did you mean to ask  why are you sad so often?   ask the moon.  ask what it has witnessed.   \n","10061

water, he insists,\\nrather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water,\\nnot simply the shackles, but the rusty,\\niron, ankle-shredding shackles\\nand that our next assignment would be\\nto jot down, off the tops of our heads,\\nour thoughts and feelings about being dead,\\nnot really an assignment,\\nthe man rotating the oar keeps telling us\\nthink of it more as an exercise, he groans,\\nthink of writing as a process,\\na never-ending, infernal process,\\nand now the boats have become jammed together,\\nbow against stern, stern locked to bow,\\nand not a thing is moving, only our diligent
